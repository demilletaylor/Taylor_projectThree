# DemilleTaylor_ProjectThree: Social Justice Festival
 ## Project Overview
I created a conceptual festival called the "People's Block Party" in support of the People's Programs organization based in Oakland, CA. People's Program is not a direct successor or the Black Panther Party, however they are building on the Panther's foundation with their free breakfast program, mobile clinics, and legal & bail support. I had to build a complete brand identity for the festival and create a corresponding GitHub repository. For my brand identity, my goal was to emulate the art style of Emory Douglas, the former Minister of Culture for the Black Panther Party. Douglas designed all official BPP publications: pamphlets, newpapers, flyers, leaflets, etc.  My color palette consists of bright neon hues, bold "printing press" style type, and texture. As for the logistics for the festival, I chose Lake Merritt as the location, as an ode to Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale's founding of the party while attending Merritt College. My programming includes mobile clinics from opening and closing each day of the festival, (no wristband/admission required), panels and activities featuring former Panthers, recycling drives and many different Black vendors. The festival concert finale will include Bay Area born & raised musicians En Vogue, Tony! Toni! Tone!, Sheila E., and Carlos Santana. Our final headliner will be the legendary Stevie Wonder.

Official statement/description of the festival: "The People's Block Party is a three-day festival dedicated to service and celebrating culture. Our three-day lineup consists of panels, workshops, food, art, live music, and health services. Join us in the true spirit of the Black Panther Party's dedication to education, safety, health, and wellness."
 ## Technical Overview 
   This website is done with HTML and CSS. For each page, I incorporated responsive sizing.
    With this project, I did more in-depth branding development and wireframing to have a clear direction of what I wanted my site to looks like.
